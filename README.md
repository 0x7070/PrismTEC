# PrismTEC
PrismTEC: The Prism Threat Enrichment and Correlation engine ingests alerts, normalizes it into a standardized format, enriches any IOCs with threat intelligence, calculates risk and confidence scores, and exports the enriched IOC information as formatted JSON generalized to support platform-ambiguity.

---

## Operational Layers

**Layer 1: Data Ingestion and Normalization**
- Ingest bulk or isolated threat data (from "predictable structured data")
  - Supported formats:
    - `Splunk`, `XSOAR`
- Reformat ingested data to PrismTEC JSON-Struct



---

## Sources for Threat Intelligence Enrichment

| ***Intelligence Focus Area*** | ***Source*** |
| --- | --- |
| **IPv4 Address** | `AbuseIPDB`, `VirusTotal`, `Shodan` |
| **Domain** | `VirusTotal`, `Whois` |
| **URL** | `VirusTotal`, `URLScan` |

IP:
- Reputation (is this bad):
  - VirusTotal/AbuseIPDB
- Infrastructure (what is it):
  - ipinfo
- Exposure (what is it doing):
  - Shodan
- DNS Relationships (what is it connected to?)
  - SecurityTrails
- Context (why does it matter):
  - GreyNoise (noise vs threat classification)
  - OTX (campaign context)

## Setup Instructions:
- Clone this repo
- Navigate to `/PrismTEC/` (where the `pyproject.toml` is located)
  - Install modules and fix PATH:
    - `pip install -e .`
- Add your API keys to `./CONFIG.json`
